## Project Overview  
The Fake News Detection App evaluates the authenticity of news content using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.  
Users can submit any news text, and the system instantly responds with a prediction, supported by a trained model that analyzes linguistic patterns, phrasing, and statistical text features.

The application provides a multi-section interface that includes a detector tool, project description, dataset insights, sample news examples, and a full architecture overview.
