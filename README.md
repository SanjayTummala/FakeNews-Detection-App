## 🧩 Project Overview

The Fake News Detection App enables users to input any news text and receive an immediate Fake/Real classification.  
The backend uses TF-IDF vectorization and a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, trained using a dataset of more than fifty thousand labeled samples.

The interface includes:  
• Fake news detection tool  
• Dataset insights  
• Sample fake and real news sections  
• Project explanation  
• Full architecture overview
