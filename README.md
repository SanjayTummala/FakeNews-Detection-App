# Fake News Detection – Full Stack Web Application

A complete Machine Learning–powered web application designed to classify news text as Fake or Real.  
This project integrates a trained ML model, a Flask-based backend API, and a modern React frontend, deployed across fully managed cloud platforms.

The system is designed with clarity, responsiveness, and professional presentation, making it suitable for academic reviews, portfolios, and production-style ML demonstrations.

## Project Overview

The Fake News Detection App allows users to submit any news content and instantly receive a Fake/Real classification.  
The prediction pipeline uses TF-IDF vectorization and a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier trained on a comprehensive dataset of more than fifty thousand labeled samples.  

The user interface includes detection tools, dataset insights, project explanation, example news samples, and a complete architectural breakdown of the system.
